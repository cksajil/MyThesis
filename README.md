### A repository containing supporting source codes and other materials of the Ph.D. thesis titled "Studies into Characterizing and Negating Certain Noise Signal".

### Supplementary code to reproduce the results

### Dependencies
* Python 2.7.(Prefered Anaconda Distribution)
* Numpy, Scipy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
* Code is written with to do computations in parallel on a 4 Node Cluster Computing Facility. Running on a normal PC might take more time.

### How to run the program
Open terminal in any of the Cluster(e.g. Cluster_0) directory and run.
```sh
$ python RunMeClustered.py
```
This will do the simulation and log the results. In our case it took around ~12 Hours.

### Recreate the figures
```sh
$ python ScatterMap.py
```
